Desciption
offline version of the famous battleship game with a PC opponent. Used my own algorithm to design PC opponent which randomly hits the board until it detects when a ship part is hit, breaks the random hit process and follows the algorithm to keep trying on the squares around the hit part until it sinks the whole ship, then it carries on in random fashion again. A red square is a hit. A blue square is a miss!

Basic Rules of Battleship Game:
Each player puts 5 ships onto his board, which his opponent can't see.
player only loses his turn when he misses.
Each player has 5 ships on his board. The ships and their lengths:
Carrier:5 squares
Battleship: 4 squares 
Frigate: 3 suares
Sunmarine: 3 squares
Minesweeper: 2 squares
The player who wins is the one who sinks his opponents' 5 ships first.
